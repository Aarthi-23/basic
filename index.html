<p><i><b>"Italian food</b> is bold and satisfying without being heavy. It's rich and textural and uses a whole palette of flavors," says <strong> Michael Chiarello</strong>, chef and owner of Bottega in <strong>California's Napa Valley </strong> and author of cookbook Bottega.<br> "Enjoying Italian cuisine is experiential, not intellectual. It comes from an emotional place that's very evocative."</i></p>
